words, we shall find it to have a far stronger resemblance to b than to
any other Old-Latin MS. It is of course a wearisome and difficult task
to note down the minute points—each inconclusive in itself--in which q

lished a small community near his native town: his fame both for
preaching and miracles, however, soon extended far and wide. After
fourteen years spent in this life he undertook a journey to Rome
(c. 714 A. D.), for devotional purposes; but Pope Gregory II persuaded ⁴
him against his will to accept the office of 3 missionary bishop, and he
was accordingly consecrated as a ‘ regionarius episcopus? He returned,
and spent some time in preaching throughout Gaul; after which he
again retired to his cell at Chartres, where he spent another seven years
with the brethren.

He then made a second journey to Rome with the intention of
obtaining the permission os the Pope to retire elsewhere for a lise of
