tinct¹y characteristic os the European class of MSS„ and there are but
few in which q agrees with f against the older family. We have the
⁸ dabit’ os d, f, i, q, Am. in Luke xi. 11 against the ⁸ porriget ’ of a and
b 3 ⁸ miratae sunt ' in v. 14, d, f, q, Am. against the ⁸ stupebant ' or ‘ obstu-
pebant ’ of a, b, i, etc.; ⁸ paenitet me' in xvii. 4 with f, Am. against
the ‘ paeniteor ' of b, d, and the ‘ paenitentiam ago’ of (a) and e; v. 8,
‘ post haec ’ with d, f, Am. against the ⁸ postea ' of a, e, and the ⁸ sic ' of b.
These are about all the cases that we can notice of agreement with the
revised family against the older European group.

On the other side the agreements with b are both numerous and
important, and we may instance. xi. 21, ‘ea quae possidet’ (b, q, Am.)
against⁸ omnia quae possidet’ (f); 22, ‘distribuet' against ‘dividet’
“ of f; xiii. 17, ⁸ aduersario eius’ against ⁸ qui resistebant ei,’ and
‘quae uiderant fieri ad ipso ’ against ⁸ quae uidebatur fieri ab eo ’ς
25, ‘ et pulsare’ against ‘et pulsauerit ostium’3 32, ⁸ite dicite ' against
⁸ ite et dicite'; xvii. 6, ⁸ utique obaudisset uobis' against ⁸et oboe-
diret uobis '3 12, ⁸ ingredienti ei ’ against ‘cum ingrederetur,’ and ⁸ quodam
castello ' against ⁸ quoddam castellum ’; 18, ⁸ rediret et . . . ageret’ against
⁸ reuerteretur et daret,' and ⁸ gratias ' against ⁸ gloriam '3 22, ‘ ut ' instead
of ‘quando ’ before ‘ desideretis ’; 24, ⁸ fulgurans de caelo lucet in his sub
caelo sunt ² is read by b, q alone, against ⁸ coruscans in his quae sub
caelo sunt fulget ’ off, while the other MSS. differ both from f and q,
and also among themselves; 27, ⁸ nubebant ’ against ‘nubtum dabant’3
xix. 4, ⁸ illa parte ’ against ‘inde ’3 7, ⁸ murmurauerunt ' against ⁸ murmu-
rabant,’ and ⁸ deuertit’ against ⁸ intrauit ’3 8, ⁸ quid alicui ' against ⁸ quid
aliquem’3 15, ⁸ quantum quisque' against ⁸ quis quantum.' These in-
stances, and more might be quoted, shew pretty conclusively, we think,
that in the great mass of the text and in turns of expression q is really
a text of the b and not of the s type.

The peculiar readings of q in these chapters do not seem to present
us with anything striking, or suggestive as to any further light on the
origin of the MS.; they are as follows z—xi. 16, ⁸ ab eo de celo quaere-
bant,' q standing alone in arranging the words in this order3 20, ⁸ utique’
before ⁸ praeuenit ’ against the ⁸ certe ' of a2, ⁸ profecto ’ of s, i, Am„ ⁸ for-
sitam’ of d ς xiii. 24, ‘ querunt introire et non potuerunt ’ against the

⁸ quaerunt intrare et non poterunt ’ of most of the other MSS. In xvii. 7
