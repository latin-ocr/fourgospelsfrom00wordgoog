INTRODUCTION.

§m General Notice. Some apology is perhaps needed for the length
of time which has elapsed between the first advertisement of this book
and its actual appearance. 'But though Ι went to Munich as long ago as
September, 1884, to revise the proof-sheets of the manuscript ¹ with the
manuscript itself, the large amount of labour which fell to my share as
joint editor of the second number of ‘ Old-Latin Biblical Texts,’ and
other pressing dutieS, have prevented me from working continuously at
the Munich MS. Even now my Introduction is not so complete as Ι
could wish, though Ι trust that the relation of the text to that of other
Old-Latin MSS. may receive fuller treatment in time to come at the hands
of Dr. Sanday. I have however spared no effort to make the printed
text a representation as correct as possible of the written one.

Ι was able to work for a little over four weeks at Munich in revising
the proof-sheets and examining the MS„ and my labours were much
lightened by the kind assistance of Dr. Laubmann, the Director of the
Hos-Bibliothek‚ and Dr. Wilhelm Meyer, then the Secretary, but now
Professor at Gottingen: to them Ι owe my thanks for their courtesy in
answering my questione, and in furnishing me with information, both
while Ι was at Munich, and also afterwards. Especially must Ι thank
Dr. Meyer for his advice, and for the assistance of his experience in
deciding difficult points in the MS„ and notably in the lectionary noteS.

in the Hos-Bibliothek at Munich, whither it was transferred in 1802 with
the rest of the Monastic Library of F reising, in which it was numbered
24. Since the time of Tischendorf it has been cited as q. It is thus
