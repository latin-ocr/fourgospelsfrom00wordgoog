MS. ; b indeed seems to be almost a typical European MS„ as the other
MSS. os European and os Italian origin, such as a,f, h, i, q, r, all re-
semble b more closely than they resemble each other.

teresting in themselves„ will hardly throw light on the main question of
the assignment of q to thes or to the b group os Old-Latin texts.
