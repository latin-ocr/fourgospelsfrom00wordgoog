EX TERNAL DESCRIPTJON. xvii

which are added above the line, are not corrections, but part of the
scribe's regular scheme of writing3 most of the vowels (he seems to have
had a special fondness sor writing 0 in this way), are added towards the
end of the line, and generally when the line is more than usually long.
He seems then to have written them thus on purpose to avoid making
the line run beyond⁶ the limits ruled for it; indeed he has osten added
them in this way at the end of the line, where, of course, had he been
merely correcting a slip, there would have been no reason why he should
not have written them in the ordinary manner aster the last letter.

Correctors. Besides the original scribe, two later hands have been
at work on the margin and text os the MS.

The first is that of the 8th or 9th century scribe (sor to this date his
hand is assigned by Prof. Meyer) who has added the various notes in
the margin, marking such portions of the Gospels as were appointed sor
lessons on Sundays and Saints' days (see below, p. liii); he has also
added the crosses in the text to mark the beginning and ending of the
lessous, The ink is black, and the writing big and straggling, ugly to
look at, much abbreviated, and extremely difficult to read. 1 trust,
however, that, partly throughthe kind assistance of Pros. Meyer, 1 have
deciphered these noteS‚ at any rate in most caseS, correctly. Of the
grammar and orthography of this scribe, all that can be said is that they
are worthy of his handwriting. He has also made a few corrections os
no critical importance in the text, such as the insertion of letters omitted
by the first hand.

One or two slight notes have also been added by a small and neat
hand of the 14th century, who has again corrected some saults in ortho-
graphy by the original scribe, and has written the inscription in the
second page of the book, ‘lib iste δ sce marie sciq' corbiniani frisinge.'
This hand has also been guilty of a piece os unintentional humour on the
page which ends St. J ohn’s Gospel and begins that of St. Luke3 the
blank spaces above and below the inscription ‘ secundum iohannem expt
amen . . . . incipit secundum lukan ' have been as usual ornamented with
roughly·drawn figures of animals3 so roughly drawn indeed are they,
that they seem to have much exercised the later student as to what
were the ani mals they were intended to represent3 and he has recorded
his conclusion by writing ‘ serpentes' against a long object without
