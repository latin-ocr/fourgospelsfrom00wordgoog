EX TERNAL DES CRIP TI ΟΝ. xv

more often, Ι think, the result of carelessness on the part of the scribe
than of intention. But although the very formation os his handwriting
and the numberless corrections of his own slips*by himself, shew him to
have been a careless writer, it is at the same time unadvisable to dismiss
the problem of a peculiarly-spelt word on the ground of carelessness
until other means os solving it have sailed. A fuller comparative
examination of early Latin MSS. may strengthen the supposition
that cases os apparently careless spelling may be really due not to
accident, but to different modes of pronunciation current in the regions to
which the MS. or its ancestors belonged: and thus the orthography of a
MS. may throw great light on the origin of the text which it presentS.
Ι have therefore collected some of the more regularly recurring cases of
peculiar orthography in q.

In the vowels ae and e seem interchangeable3 Iudea and Iudaea are
found impartially ; Abraee in Luke iii. 83 Esaias and AEsaias, Matt. xv.
73 xiii. 143 Cesar, Matt. xxii. 21 ; egrimonia, terre, prestat, etc.; and on
the other hand aedunt, blassaemiae, habaebat, occultae3 a is found occa-
sionally for e: genaratiO, Matt. xxiv. 343 processarat, Luke ii. 36 ; u and
0 are occasionally interchanged: soffuco and suffuc0, Matt. xiii. 7, 223
Luke viii. 7, 14, 333 diurnu, Matt. xx. 2 ; pseodoxpi, Matt. xxiv. 243 and
speodoprqfetzs, Luke vi. 26. In the consonante we may notice examples
of ‘dittography,’ consummat, Luke ix. 543 atullerunt, John ii. 8 3 and
Jordannis usually (but not John iii. 26, etc.); s is more frequently doubled‚
² as in accussarent, effussus, occissa, transsire, etc.‚ and is frequently added
af ter x, as in benedzlrserint, dixserunt, crucifixserunt, 2·ntellexsist2·s, surrexsit,
exsiens, exsemplum, exsercitum, maxsillam, etc.; and yet side by side ⁴with
these we have such forms as audisent, ingresus, percusit, misus, posumus ,·
the omission and insertion of lt seem to shew that then as now that
letter had an uncertain foothold in popular pronunciation, and, expelled
from places to which it rightly belonged, revenged itself by trespassing
where it had no claim 3 we have on the one hand abuisti, ora (haur), odie,
ospes, proibere‚ etc., and on the other hira, habundantius, hariolorum,
habiit, hirta, etc. The omission os other letters may be due partly to
slovenly and hasty pronunciation, partly to careless writing3 we have
mandcare, pactum, mlius, spientibus, in which not only a letter but a
syllable is lost, and also autm and atem (for autem), sient (for scient),
