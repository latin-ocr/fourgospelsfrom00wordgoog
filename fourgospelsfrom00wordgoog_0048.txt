all the more valuable, as it will be unconscious testimony disclosed by
the way, when they were being quoted with a different aim.

There are some sixty-three instances in the analysis of a² and s in
which q presents us with readings of any interest as shewing its relation
to other MSS. Out of these sixty-three instances there are thirty-four
of agreement with b against s, and only nine of agreement with s against
b; in eight readings q stands alone, and in eight it agrees with the com-
posite text of ff„ against both b ands.

To take the more noticeable cases of reading—as opposed to ren·
dering-first: in Luke xi. 13 the clause ‘ cum autem haec dixisset ad-
duxerunt ad eum unum daemoniacum surdum et mutum ' found in s, and
with minor variations in a2, c, d, is omitted by b, i, q and Am.; in v. 22
‘ eius ' is omitted after ‘ spolia ’ in b, q, but inserted in the other MSS.; in
v. 25 ‘ scopis mundatam ’ is read by b, i, q, A m.‚ while f (with l, ὃ) insert
‘vacantem' as well; in v. 28 ‘ ad eos’ is added after ‘ dixit' in b, i, q,
but omitted in d, e, f, Am. In xiii. 17 the simple ‘praeclarius’ is read
in b, i, q against the ‘ uniuersis praeclaris uirtutibus ’ off, the other MSS.
agreeing in inserting either ‘ uniuersis ’ or ‘ omnibus?

These are all the noticeable cases of differences of reading which
imply a variation in the underlying Greek text, and, as we shall see, they
are paralleled by about an equal number os cases in which q has s readings
opposed to those of b3 these are as follows :—

Luke xi. 13 ‘ spiritum sanctum‚’ s, q, (cp. Am. ‘spiritum bonum’),
against ‘bonum datum ’ or ‘ bona data' of the European MSS.; v. 18
the addition of ‘ satanan eicit ’ to ‘ si satanas: before ‘in seipsum diuisus
est‚' is found in f, i, q, but not in a„ b or d 3 v. 24 (d) f, q have ‘ loca arida ’
against ‘loca quae non habent aquam ’ os b (i), while αἱί and Ambrose in
his commentary on St. Luke combine the two readings in ‘arida loca
quae aquam non habent.’ In xiii. 33 the clause ‘ uerumtamen oportet me
hodie et cras et sequenti ire ’ is found with slight variations in s, q, Am„
and, in a slightly different form, also in a, d, e, but is omitted in b, i.
Thus in cases of reading q seems to hold a middle place between b ands
in St. Luke as in the other Gospels3 it is revised in some placeS, unre-
vised in others.

If we examine its renderz‘1.gs the conclusion suggested by the other
Gospels will be considerably strengthened; the large majority are dis-
