IN TR ODUCTI ΟΝ. xix

capital letter5‚ especially where the verse number has to be placed over
them, are indented slightly within the line instead of projecting into the
margin, as they do in the MS.; final m or n, as was noticed above, is
usually marked by a line after the letter with a dot under the centre of
the line3 but it has been found simpler to print the dot under the end of
the line; the three or four dots which the scribe has placed at the end
of a sentence are written sometimes quite close to each other, sometimes
sar apart‚ but in printing it was found necessary to place them at equal
distances; indeed, it is obviously impossible to reproduce in a printed
edition all such minute characteristics as these of the written Manuscript3
but 1 have taken all the care 1 could to make the number of the dots in
each case correspond to that of the MS„ and also throughout the text to
make the spaces between the words as nearly as possible representative
of the actual spaces left accidentally or designedly by the scribe himself.
The sentences written in colour by the scribe are marked by asterisks
added on the left-hand margin.

Our sacsimile is taken by the collotype procesS, by¹ the kind
permission of Pros. Rendell Harri3‚ from a photograph belonging to
him. To him, to Dr. Sanday, to the Bishop of Salisbury, to the Rev.
E. W. Watson who revised the ‘ notuIae,' and to all those who have so
gladly assisted and advised me in this labour of love, Ι owe my best
thanks.
