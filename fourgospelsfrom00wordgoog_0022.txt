satum (sor sactum), omis (sor omnis), aeturus (uent-)‚ iuicem, batizare,
σφω, consetim, Agusto (Luke ii. 1). Letters are dropped at the end of
wordS, giving us such forms as accesserun( t), plu(s), ueneri(t)‚ praeparatzds),
sun(t), uocan(s), and also at the beginning, as in (ι’)ὐί, (u)tique. These
instances seem to point to careless pronunciation rather than careless
writing3 but sor the following the scribe must surely be responsible :—
