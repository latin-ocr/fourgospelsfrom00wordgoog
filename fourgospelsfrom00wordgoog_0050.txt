9 stands alone in reading ‘ cui regredienti,’ but is very nearly approached
by the ‘cui regresso ’ of r, and the ‘ regredienti ’ of ὂς in 24 Am. follows
9 in ‘ filius hominis in die sua ² against ‘ aduentus fili hominis in die sua'
off, and ‘ filius hominis ’ of a, b,d‚ e; in xix. 22 q stands alone in ‘ o infi-
delis serue et piger,' though f draws near to it with ‘ serue neque et
piger)

There are also but few agreements os any great interest or suggest-
iveness with other Mss„ though we may notice sour 'agreements with a
or a2‚ ‘ ex illis: xv. 15, where the other MSS. have ‘ ex eis ’ or ⁸ ex his,'
and b, i ‘ ex phariseis ’ς the curious ‘ quod accepto’ of a, (not a) and 9 in
xiii. 193 the omission of {si ' before ⁸ septies ’ in xvii. 4 with a, e, A m„ etc„
while it is inserted by b, d, f 3 and the reading ‘ sanus' in v. 15 with a
against ‘ mundatus’ of b, d, f, A m., ‘ curatus ’ os .e, s. In the following
instances q agrees with i, Am. against the other MSS.; were it not for
the presence of i we should feel tempted to ascribe this to a slight Vul-
gate stream in q; but as i represents on the whole a pure European text,
we must attribute these readings to the influence of another branch of the
widely-spread European family on our text, which, as we have already seen,
includes such avariety os elements in its formation. The readings in question
are these z—xi. 17, ‘in 'se ipsum diuisum,’ i, q, (Am), f has ‘ semetipsum,’
b ‘ se '3 24, ‘ perambulat ’ (i), 9, Am„ ‘ ambulat ’ b, f, ‘ circuit ’ αἳ, ‘uadit ²
d ; xiii. 16, ‘ uinculo isto' i, q, Am„ ‘ uinculo hoc’ a, αὶ, d, ‘ uinculo ’ b, e,
‘ uinculis istis ⁵ f 3 21, ⁶ farinam ' i, 9, ‘ sarina' a, (12³⁶, b, ‘ farinae mensuris
tribus ' f, ‘ s. mensuras tris' d, (e, a2⁰⁰“), ‘ f. sata tria,’ A m.; 31, ‘in ipsa
die’ i, q, Am„ b, e, f insert ‘ autem'3 32, ‘ et ait illis ’ i, q, Am„ b, s add
‘ihs ’3 33, ‘ non capit ³ i, 9, Am„ ‘non est possibile’ (e), fi ‘non oportet ’
a, ag, b, d 3 xviii. 40, ‘ adpropiasset ' q, ‘ adpropinquasset’ (a), b, (d), fi Am.

It remains lastly to examine a few chapters in St. Mark, that we may
see whether our text bears out there the character which we imagine to
have been established regarding it in the other GospeIS, the character of
being fundamentally European, but altered and revised in parts so as to ·
accord with the Italian family3 we think that this will be found to be
the case in St. Mark just as much as elsewhere.
