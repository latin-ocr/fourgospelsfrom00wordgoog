noticeable than that with any other MS. A review of the analysis shews
some thirty-three agreements with b alone, against twenty-three with f ,
alone3 the agreements with a alone and with e alone are each nine, and
in seventeen instances 9 presents a peculiar reading. If we look back at
the more noticeable variations we shall see on the whole much the same
features repeated that we noticed in St. Matthew3 in the important vari-
ations of reading—variations which shew a difference in the underlying
Greek Text—q sides with s against the older manuscriptS, though some-
times the older reading is left unaltered3 but in points of translation,
grammar, turns os expression, etc., 9 is very largely free from the revision
of which f is the result.

For instance, the addition of ὅτι συνετελέσθη ὁ οἶνος τοῦ γάμου in.
ch. ii. 2 (see above, p. xxii), is excised in 9 and f, though found in
a, b, ff² and also r (Cod. Usserianus); and again in v. 9 of the same
chapter the shorter form of the verse is found with f, against the Euro-
pean addition ‘et uidentes factum mirabantur’ os a, b. In iii. 6 the
addition found in a, e, ff² and r of ‘ quia deus spiritus est ’ is excised,
though as b as well as f agree-here with 9, we may perhaps ascribe to
the inserted clause an African instead of an European origin3 nay, this
is the more likely, because in the same verse we meet with a striking
instance of the incompleteness of the Italian revision in 9, as it has the
European addition ‘ quoniam de carne natum est’ in common with a, b,
e, βξ, r, which is omitted by f. But in v. 8 of the same chapter the in·
truding ‘ aqua et’ of a, b, e, ff2‚ (r) is expelled, in company with f. In
v. 31 of the same chapter (see also p. xxii) we have an instance of what
is more rare—an addition, not an excision, in common with f; for the
‘ super omnes est ’ at the end of the verse is not found in the older texts

If we look at the readings in the left—hand column, however, which
mark the differences from f, we shall find the majority of these to con-
sist in differences of rendering, not reading3 there are different methods
of translating pompant-testimonium dico, testor, testificor, testimonium
reddo, and the revised rendering testimonium perhibet), which occurs regu-
larly in f and afterwards in the Vulgate3 in these readings q seems to
draw near to e.

In other cases the rendering is not consistent, but sometimes belongs
