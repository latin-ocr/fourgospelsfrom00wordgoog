Here again the connection between q and b, though not quite so
marked as in the former table, is still striking. In the first nine in-
stances they run together, changing from impero to praeusto, increpo, and
prohibeo at the same placeS, against f and also against a, which, though
agreeing with b in St. Matthew, begins its characteristic word obiurgo in
Mark iii. 12. In Mark iv. 39 we have a solitary agreement with f in
comminor against the impero of b, and in viii. 32 obiurgo with a; in x. 48
we may notice that though q does not share the peculiar b reading of

. minor, it does not, on the other hand, agree with f, but reads increp05 in
Luke iv. 39 it again reads impero with a, b, A m., against the increpo
