ADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS

TO

OLD-LATIN BIBLICAL TEXTS, Nos. 1 AND II.

· We are able, partly from our own revision, partly from the kind infor-
mation given by reviewers and friends, to point out the following
additions and corrections to the two previous volumes of Old-Latin

Biblical TextS, which we earnestly request our readers to note in the
margin of the pages where they occur. The most important corrections

of No. 1 are re-printed here for convenience together with a few marked
with an asterisk, which have been since discovered.
