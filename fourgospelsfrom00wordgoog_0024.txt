legs, somewhat resembling a caterpillar, and by ticketing as ‘ boues '
a primitive-looking animal with legs and horna. This hand has again
made a very few emendations of no critical value in the text.

The Printing os the M S . In editing the text of the Manuscript my
aim has been to make the printed text resemble as sar as possible the
written text of the MS. in its state on leaving the scribe’s hand after his
final revision. All corrections by the first hand have accordingly been
noted in the form which they take in the MS.; when the scribe has
written a word Wrongly, has discovered his mistake‚ and added the
correct form of the word after, with a line through and dots over the
wrong letterS, this has been reproduced in print3 where he has written
letters over incomplete wordS, they have been placed where he put them;
where there has been an erasure, tlze word erased has been printed, as it
is of course uncertain whether the erasure was by the first or by a later
hand.

The few corrections made by the second and third hands have been
placed not in the texts but in the notes which follow.

The lectionary notes, however, it was thought advisable to print in
the actual places they occupy in the Ms„ as they exercise no critical
influence on the text3 and to any student of ancient lectionaries it would
probably be more convenient to have the lessons ready to hand instead
of having to look them up in the notes.

As regards the arrangement os the text in printing, a slight departure
from the appearance of the written book was thought advisable for the
sake of convenience to the student. In several editions of MSS.², no
less than four written pages have been compressed into one printed
page, as in our own 3 but this has been done by placing the second column
opposite to the first, in the same position as in the original book. The
objection to this arrangement is that the page is thus broken up into
eight short columnS, the puzzling effect of which, for purposes of
reference, may be seen in the specimen on p. xx. It has seemed more
convenient then to print the first and second columns continuously‚
straight down the page.

In a few other points convenience of printing has also led to a slight
departure from the exact appearance of the original book3 the initial
