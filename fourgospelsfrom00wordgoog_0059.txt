Μ. THE LECTIONARY NOTES 1N q.

The following is a list of the lectionary notes; they are written in
the margin of the MS. in an ugly cursive hand of probably the 8th or 9th
century, being in some cases almost undec‘ipherable. Ι have arranged
them as far as 1 can in the chronological order of the Church's yoer3
but Ι cannot always assign a definite passage os Scripture to each lesson,
as the crosses in the text do not regularly correspond to the notes
written in the margin: as a rule, os course, two crosses are inserted,
which we may take to mark the beginning and the end3 but sometimes

only one is found, which may refer either to the beginning or the end,
sometimes none, sometimes the crosses without any corresponding lesson.

Nor does the comparison of other Lectionaries help us here, as the
lessons seem to belong to some German local use, and have few affinities
either with the ComeS, Gallican, or Mozarabic usesl.

1 can then but call attention to them m the hope that future workers
in this branch of study may be able to throw more light upon the
question.
